## Description
I created a personal portfolio website from scratch. The purpose of the site is to showcase work to employers.
-   I updated the site with my personal information.
-   I added placeholder images and names.
-   Navigation links to the correct sections, titles and placeholders. 
-   Used flexboxes for my content.
-   Added media queries to create a reponsive layout.

Also, I learned about flexboxes, media queries, and CSS variables.
